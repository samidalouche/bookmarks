I recently read and enjoyed "A Primer of GIS: Fundamental Geographic
and Cartographic Concepts" when I was looking for the same sort of
thing:

http://www.amazon.com/Primer-GIS-Fundamental-Geographic-Cartographic/dp/1593855656

That said, I chose this after some online research & haven't read very
widely in the area.

Randy,

You might want to take a look at 'Desktop GIS - The Book':
http://desktopgisbook.com/

I haven't read it, but it has good reviews from people that I respect.
 One cool aspect of the book is that utilizes OpenSource software, so
you can work through the examples and lessons without having to pay
high licensing fees.

David.

This one is a bit technical, but it's a great resource book: http://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/
There's even a free Web version, although I recommend buying a printed version for anyone into GIS
